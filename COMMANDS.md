## Latent Features
### Signups Automation 
The bot will automatically send announcements every morning at 8am and add reactions in #‚Å†üì¢event-announcements as long as it has one or more of the following emojis: :RegimentalColours:, :KingsColours:, or :UnionColours:.
Replying to a message with 'unreact' will remove the bot's reactions. Note reactions will only be removed if at least one other user has also reacted with that emoji.
