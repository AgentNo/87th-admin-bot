There are just a few housekeeping tasks to tidy up:

- Make sure to join the in-game registry. Search for '87th' and select the one led by GodEmperorBrolly.
- Ensure that in your Holdfast options, 'Use Regiment Registry Name' is enabled. This means you'll get our tags in-game.
- Join our steam group, the link for which is in #regiment-documentation.

We'll see you on the battlefield! If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask! ⚔️
